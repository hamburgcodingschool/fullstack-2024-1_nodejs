# Dice

This was given as a homework for the NodeJS course on day 3:

- Write a dice roller as a client / server app using JSON object
- You have an input field with the number of sides (e.g. 6) 
- You create a json object `{ number_of_sides: 6 }`
- Return a random number `{ rolled: 3 }`
- Display the result
- Addon:
  - Animate the result (CSS animation)
