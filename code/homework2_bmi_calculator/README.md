# BMI Calculator

This was given as a homework for the NodeJS course on day 2:

- Write a body mass calculator using forms and calculate the BMI (body mass index) on the server
  - If you have extra time:
  - Differentiate between male and female and use a radio-button in the HTML form
  - Make a nice HTML output page and color code the result (e.g. green, yellow and red)
